It’s almost time for that long-awaited family vacation, and you’re starting to make plans. With so many destination choices, how do you decide where to go? For many families, that choice is often one of America’s national parks. The U.S. government maintains hundreds of national parks, monuments, recreation areas, and historic sites that are visited by millions of people each year. These include many of the country’s most spectacular and scenic locations as well as many of its most historic and storied places. Here are seven of the best national parks the United States has to offer. Four of them are listed as UNESCO World Heritage sites.

It is hard not to list this one first—the “mother park,” the country’s and world’s first national park. Occupying the northwest corner of Wyoming and slivers of eastern Idaho and southern Montana, Yellowstone is an enchanting place. The greatest draws are its hydrothermal features—the world’s largest collection of geysers (notably the renowned Old Faithful), colorful hot pools, mud cauldrons, and hot springs and terraces. But the park also features a beautiful lake, which occupies the cauldron of an ancient volcano, and a majestic two-tiered waterfall that is at the western end the spectacular Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River that features towering multihued rock formations. Herds of bison and elk roam the park, and Yellowstone is famous for its bears—and, since the 1990s, its packs of wolves.

Just a short way south of Yellowstone in Wyoming, the magnificent Teton Range rises up sharply for more than a mile (1.6 km) from a lake-filled valley. It is one of America’s most breathtakingly scenic places and the subject of countless photographs. Sunrise on the range from a tent or from the park’s fine lodge is one of the most beautiful sights a visitor could hope to see. Hiking is popular on the park’s vast network of trails, especially in the narrow, deep valleys between the mountains with waterfalls cascading down the slopes. If you’re lucky, maybe you will get to eat lunch while watching a moose grazing nearby in a stream.</p>
